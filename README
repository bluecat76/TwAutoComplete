= TwAutoComplete - Text completion script for BareBones TextWrangler

== Introduction

This script is an extension to BareBones TextWrangler (http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/). 
On invocation, it gives you an auto-completion for the word your cursor is on, similar to those found in 
IDEs. It does this by looking through all words found in the current document only, but this can really save 
you time nonetheless.

== Installation

1. Download the latest TwAutocomplete.zip from here: http://github.com/bluecat76/TwAutoComplete/raw/master/download/TwAutoComplete_r1.zip
2. Open TextWrangler and select "Open Scripts Folder" from the scripts menu (scroll symbol).
3. Extract TwAutoComplete.zip and copy the folder TwAutoComplete to the scripts folder opened before.
4. Set a key combination to run it (f.i. CTRL-SPACE). You can do this by selecting 
"Window/Palettes/Scripts" in the Menu and using the "Set Key..." button for the 
"run TwAutoComplete" script inside the folder.

== Usage

You can use the selected key kombination to complete the word you begin to write. Use the 
key kombination repeatedly to switch through all available completion possibilities.
If you have f.i. a text like 'This is a test text.' and you invoke TwAutoComplete after 
writing a 't' afterwards, you get 'est' and on the next invocation 'ext' as completion selection. 

== Description

Since Barebones removed the BBXT-Plug-In interface from TextWrangler with version 3.5,
TwAutoComplete now uses a special commandline tool (findcomp) using the script interface
to find completions to the current selection.

Please let me know, if you have improvements. And no, a selection box of completions is 
NOT possible using this tool. At least not as far as I know, if you know better, please 
write me an e-mail.
