= TwAutoComplete - Text completion script for BareBones TextWrangler

== Introduction

This script is an extension to BareBones TextWrangler (http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/).
On invocation, it auto-completes the word your cursor is on, similar to auto-completion found in IDEs.
The script looks through all the words found in the current document only, but this can really save
you time nonetheless.

== Installation

1. Download the latest TwAutocomplete.zip from here: http://github.com/bluecat76/TwAutoComplete/raw/master/download/TwAutoComplete_r1.zip
2. Open TextWrangler and select "Open Scripts Folder" from the scripts menu (scroll symbol).
3. Extract TwAutoComplete.zip and copy the folder TwAutoComplete to the scripts folder opened before.
4. Set a key combination to run it (f.i. CTRL-SPACE). You can do this by selecting
"Window/Palettes/Scripts" in the Menu and using the "Set Key..." button for the
"run TwAutoComplete" script inside the folder.

== Usage

You can use the selected key combination to complete a word as you begin to write. Use the
key combination repeatedly to switch through all available completion possibilities.
For example, if you are editing a file with only this text in it, 'This is a test text.'
If you type a 't' after this line and invoke TwAutoComplete you will get 'est' with the first
invocation and on the next invocation 'ext' as completion selections.

== Description

Since Barebones removed the BBXT-Plug-In interface from TextWrangler with version 3.5,
TwAutoComplete now uses a special commandline tool (findcomp) using a script interface
to find completions to the current selection.

== Contributions

Please let me know, if you have improvements. And no, a selection box of completions is
NOT possible using this tool. At least not as far as I know, if you know better, please
write me an e-mail.

Thanks to:
* Daniel B. - improving the readme
